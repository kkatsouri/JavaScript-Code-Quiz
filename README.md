JavaScript Code Quiz

Description:
The goal of this Quiz was to use JavaScript to present a series of questions to the user. The aim was to employ basic javascript skills learn over the last three weeks of class. The quiz interface was to feature a timer, a score counter and a series of quiz questions and answer options that automatically change once answered. At the completion of the quiz the user should be able to enter their initials to keep track of highscores. 

This project is currently unfinished. As a student new to coding I have found the introduction to JavaScript to be challenging but with time I will hopefully develop the skills I need to one day make this quiz functional. Though I was not successful in completing this project I learnt a lot about problem solving, and had o really practice thinking about what recently studies concepts could help achieve desired outcomes. 

Usage:
The user should be able to press the start button to initate the quiz and move through the questions by selecting answers. If a wrong answer is chosen 5 seconds should be removed frrom the clock. At completion of the quiz the user should be presented with a form in which to enter their initials. By pressing the highscore button previous highscores should be viewed.
